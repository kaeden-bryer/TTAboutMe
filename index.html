                    I was actually born on the first day of work. Before that, I was just sitting in a room eating saltine crackers and watching TV.

                    Since volleyball is at least 70% of my personality, odds are if you know somebody who plays volleyball, chances are they know me. I'm also the president of the club volleyball team at Oakland.

                <div>
                    From the ages of 13-17, I lived in Suzhou, China. I attended an international school called SSIS, and this experience shaped who I am tremendously. It's probably the greatest experience a teenager could ask for.

                    Yes, this is real. I run a 45 minute stage show three times a day at the Holly Renaissance Festival. I juggle, entertain and tell bad jokes.

                    I'm the VP of GrizzHacks! This March over 170 students from 15+ universities came to Oakland to compete, and it was my job to run opening and closing ceremonies, as well as coordinate the sponsors and judges.

                    I just think this is cool. Took some old skateboards my friends gifted me and used them to make a shelf above my bed. Great for reading at night.
